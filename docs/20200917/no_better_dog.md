# No Better Dog

The last few weeks have been confusing to say the least. Though I believe it makes more sense if we quickly recap what Patia went through last year.

## Surgery Last Year

In late July 2019 Patia started limping after getting up quickly in response to another dog running near her at the park. She gave a "wince" cry at the time. 

This was the then most recent, though not the first, time that she had winced in response to a sudden movement or awkward landing over the preceding three years (roughly). In each of the earlier occasions she would limp for less than a minute, and though I'd mentioned these incidents at annual checkups, we had not yet identified enough of a pattern to take images.

This time though, it got worse over the next few days and we _did_ take images. In them we discovered that her left femur had what looked like - and was later confirmed to be - a significant cancer tumor at the top of the bone, near the ball of the hip. As she was a fracture risk, I scrambled to find a specialist center that could both provide oncology and surgery. The clinic able to help us soonest was VRCC in Englewood, CO.

The few weeks before the surgery were very painful and stressful for Patia, but happily we avoided a fracture and Patia had a successful surgery in August 2019 to remove her rear left leg and a significant portion of her hip, to provide 'margin'.

Patia was kept overnight after the surgery but was able to come home the next day. As is standard in such procedures the area around the incision were shaved, she was sedated, and a powerful time release drug _in_ the tissues was used to reduce the immediate pain following surgery and to provide a window for getting Patia on a reasonable schedule of pain medication to help here during the recovery.

In practice, what this meant was that Patia experienced being left at VRCC, being sedated and shaved (not sure of the order), coming home and for the first 24 or so hours being able to get up and down - and even lay on the incision area - without significant discomfort. However, after the first day or so of anti pain, antibiotics, and nerve medication in her snacks and food, Patia became strongly food adverse and ultimately ground or de-capsulated anti-biotics and nerve medication were mixed into human food for the next few weeks. Lots of "burrito bowls" and peanut butter; though she would refuse even these if the last batch included pain medication.

After a few really rough and slow improvement weeks the stitches came out, and within 48 hours of that being able to rest on both sides comfortably made all the difference. Within a few weeks of having the stitches out, only the slowly growing back hair made any one think she'd not been a "tripawd" all her life.

Chemo was no fun, but only really made for a handful of bad days, and on the whole Patia has had a very good year, for which I am extremely grateful.

## Metastasis and a Minor Diagnostic Onslaught

Most dogs who have osteosarcoma later develop metastatic cancer in some other tissues and the median age for these animals is roughly a year, even with chemotherapy. Other experimental treatment options are available, though there are risks and we chose only chemo and quarterly imaging to monitor for metastasis. Regrettably, this is what we saw in early August of this year. At that time, the recommendation was to have the next images at about one month to get some idea of the rate of progression, and this is what we did in early September.

Both sets of images show what appeared to be a tumor in the lung. There was a little uncertainty about this, and there was also the possibility of other metastatic growths that images miss but that ultra sound might show. For these and on the general principle that I wanted as much information as we could get - without impacting quality of life - about Patia's health as possible, I decided on consultation with VRCC to have ultrasound completed and to perform Fine Needle Aspiration to obtain a sample of the visible tumor. These procedures were performed on Friday 18 September.

Thus, Patia experienced being left at VRCC (though for a shorter time), being sedated (but mor mildly) and shaved (not sure of the order), and then coming home. That Friday evening she was a bit withdrawn, but I chalked that up to the long drives and the sedation. 

That weekend, her appetite and energy level were consistent with the variance I'd come to expect over the last few months, though she was more keen on attention and was a little jumpy when her belly was touched, this latter I attributed at the time to the hair having been shaved.

Monday marked a sharp decline. Patia did not want to get out of bed, was not interested in kibble or treats, and would wince when she rose or lay down. This continued for the next few days, including some restless nights, culminating with a emergency exam on Wednesday 23 September. That evening, I started making here the same food I had post surgery a year earlier, made certain that there were no tears or obstructions in here paws - one pad was dry enough to be sensitive, so I made sure to apply paw wax for a few days - and switched into vigilance mode. If she got up _at all_ we went out. If she wanted to walk, we did. If she wanted to go home, we did.

Over the next several days she improved. Initially, she walked for short distances and with a slow, slightly awkward gait where here front legs were a bit "bow legged". She was "touchy" around her stomach and - though there was no reason to be - in her hip area from the surgery last year fow a few days. I had to ease into these areas during tummy rubs, though this returned to normal a few days ago. There were a few winces, but less frequent, and as of today I've not heard one for almost a week. Similarly, we've been able to transition back to kibble, though now about 20% freeze dried raw meat of one species or another. She also continues to refuse the CBD peanut butter treats that had, until two weeks ago, been almost her favorite thing to eat. Happily, bison lung is delicious, and this is what we now dish out for rewards and fun.

My initial hypothesis, based in part on conversations with several of the Vets, was that the tumor had - by coincidence - gotten just big enough to start pinching something at the same time as our ultrasound/FNA visit. Perhaps she needed to adjust how she rose, lay down, and walked to avoid discomfort.

However, the last several days - though I continue to let her "drive" and thus at _her motivation_ - we have returned to 2-3 mile walks at a normal speed with no alteration in her gait compared with a month or more ago. And, in general, she is behaving as she had prior to the diagnostic visit.

This leads me to a second hypothesis; triggered response. Based on her traumatic experience from last year and her recovery then, the mild discomforts of the FNA soreness and dry/torn paw reinforced her expectation that after you go to "that place", get shaved and sedated, don't trust the food and be prepared to feel miserable for a while.

Now, I know that it is easy to read this and just think I am some over anthropomorphizing, over protective dog dad and, well... guilty. 

However, I also know that Patia is smart pup even if she does not have all the information, and _if_ such a response _were_ the best explanation, it fits what we've observed better than the first hypothesis.

## Last Days, May They Be Many

Of course, both or neither of these hypotheses may be correct, and at the end of the day what matters is a happy pup. Quality of life was bad enough for a few days that "intervention" as the euthanasia specialist I've spoken to puts it was an option I knew I should be prepared for. Though Patia has "bounced back" in a beautiful and unexpected way, I'm still vigilant of her respiration and mindful that though thankfully happy at the moment, she is still a very sick pooch. The time she stays with us has to be for _her_, and not for me; but I think we have a little longer yet.

My objective remains the same as it has been, to let Patia have as many happy days as possible without trauma - either physical or emotional. And to make sure that whatever (very little fingers crossed) poking and prodding she has yet to endure is with "dad" nearby so that there can be as much love, and as little fear, as possible.

> Note: This revision is a snap shot as of early October 2020, and earlier text about Patia is currently in draft form, to be added at a future time. Part of that draft was initially intended for the 17 September 2020 addition to these essays, but caring for the pup took precedence over writing about her. This revision is also somewhat clinical, as it was prepared in part to share with Patia's Veterinarian providers.

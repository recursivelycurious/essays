# No Better Dog

The last few weeks have been confusing to say the least. Though I believe it makes more sense if we quickly recap what Patia went through last year.

## Surgery Last Year

In late July 2019 Patia started limping after getting up quickly. Another dog had run close behind her at the park, where she had been dutifully fulfilling her aloof husky responsibilities by watching the other dogs play. Her observing from the wings and even the flyby was pretty normal. The "wince" cry she gave was not. 

This was the then most recent, though not the first, time that she had winced after sudden movement or an awkward landing. It happened perhaps a few times a year; she would limp for a minute or less, look forlorn for a few more, then be back to normal. The vets and I had discussed these incidents at annual checkups, though the quick resolutions and low frequency meant we never took images.

This time though, it got worse over the next few days and we _did_ take images. In them we discovered that Patia's left femur had what looked like - later confirmed - a significant cancer tumor at the top of the bone, near the ball of the hip. As she was a fracture risk, I scrambled to find a specialist center that could provide both oncology and surgery. The clinic able to help us soonest was VRCC in Englewood, CO.

The few weeks before the surgery were very painful and stressful for Patia, but happily we avoided a fracture and she had a successful surgery in August 2019. Her rear left leg and a significant portion of her hip - to provide 'margin' - were removed.

Patia was kept overnight after the surgery but was able to come home the next day. As is standard in such procedures the area around the incision was shaved, she was sedated, and a powerful time release drug _in_ the tissues reduced the immediate pain for the first few days following surgery. She could even lay comfortably on the incision, though I understood this would pass when that post op drug wore off. The oral pain meds would help, but could not be as direct and effective.

In practice, what this meant was that Patia experienced being left at VRCC, being sedated and shaved (not sure of the order), coming home and for the first 24 or so hours being able to get up and down, and get entirely off her remaining rear leg for a bit without significant discomfort. As that drug wore off, the pain kicked in. I dutifully followed the prescribed medication schedule, but Patia was not a fan.  After the first day or so of anti pain, antibiotics, and nerve medication in her snacks and food, Patia became strongly food adverse. I chatted with the surgeon, who stressed that the antibiotics and nerve meds were key to her recovery and she suggested getting creative with the food choices. A lot of experimentation with different foods finally got us to something that worked; ground or de-capsulated anti-biotics and nerve medication mixed into homemade "burrito bowls" or peanut butter; though she would refuse even these if the last batch included pain medication. Apparently, narcotics are not her style. As I have said many times, she is a smart dog.

After a few really rough weeks, with gradual but slow improvement, the stitches came out. The good leg had been getting super tired. Even when she lay down to rest, the good leg had to bear the weight. The side with the incision, the stitches, and the healing bone was just too sensitive. As she healed, she tried to use that side to rest, but it was just too much. Once the stitches were out, she could rest on the left side comfortably, and it made all the difference. Within days of having the stitches out she moved without any observable pain, only the slowly growing back hair made anyone think she'd not been a "tripawd" all her life.

Over the next few months she just kept improving. She even became a bit less aloof at the park, playing with another dog here and there.Clearly she'd been in a fair amount of discomfort for months before I knew she was sick. Many of the changes in her behavior I had attributed to age - Patia turned seven the November after her surgery - now seemed much more likely to be an effect of that tumor and the cancer behind it.

There were challenges of course. Stairs and very steep hikes were disasters waiting to happen, so we started to avoid them. I insisted on lifting Patia into the Jeep, which clearly frustrated - or maybe embarrassed - her at first. She was strong enough to make the jump, but the consequences of a miss were just too high; tripawds have no spare. And chemo was no fun, but only really made for a handful of bad days, and on the whole Patia has had a very good year, for which I am extremely grateful.

## Metastasis and a Minor Diagnostic Onslaught

Most dogs who have osteosarcoma later develop metastatic cancer in some other tissues and the median survival for these animals is roughly a year, even with chemotherapy. Other experimental treatment options are available, though there are risks, and in the end I chose only chemo and quarterly imaging to monitor for metastasis. Regrettably, predictably, this is what we saw in early August of this year. At that time, the recommendation was to have the next images at about one month to get some idea of the rate of progression, and this is what we did in early September.

Both sets of images show what appeared to be a tumor in the lung. There was a little uncertainty about this, and there was also the possibility of other metastatic growths that images miss but that ultrasound might show. For these reasons, and on the general principle that I wanted as much information as I could get - without impacting quality of life - that might help avoid pain or trauma I decided to have ultrasound and Fine Needle Aspiration (FNA) completed to obtain a sample of the visible tumor. These procedures were performed on Friday 18 September 2020 at VRCC.

Thus, Patia experienced being left at VRCC (though for a shorter time), being sedated (but more mildly) and shaved (not sure of the order), and then coming home. That Friday evening she was a bit withdrawn, but I chalked that up to the long drives and the sedation. 

That weekend, her appetite and energy level were consistent with the variance I'd come to expect over the last few months, though she was more keen on attention and was a little jumpy when her belly was touched. I attributed the sensitivity to the hair having been shaved.

Monday marked a sharp, sudden decline. Patia did not want to get out of bed. She was not interested in kibble or treats, and would wince when she rose or lay down. She even turned down peanut butter. _You know things are serious when a dog turns down peanut butter_. This continued for the next few days, including some restless nights. The vets and their staffs wanted to help, but could offer little that would be likely to help. For my own sanity, just to make sure I was not missing anything, we had an emergency exam on Wednesday 23 September, but no new information. Patia was a sad pup, she winced for reasons we could not pin to anything specific, and she'd just been through all the diagnostics that might show more. Should we repeat them the vet asks? Should we give her intravenous fluids since she is not drinking? Should we give her drugs to stimulate her appetite? The vet is laying out options, but they all sound terrible and more for me than for Patia. No needles. No drugs. I wanted to be sure I was not missing anything like internal bleeding or the like. If not, I'll come pick up my dog now thank you very much. Though the consultation is over the phone thanks to covid, from her voice I think the vet thinks I made the right decision. 

They send me home with an appetite stimulate just in case, but I opt not to use it. That evening, I make her the same food as post surgery a year earlier. I also made certain that there were no tears or obstructions in her paws. One pad was dry enough to be sensitive, so I made sure to apply paw wax to all three that night and next (and as needed since). As after the surgery, I switched into vigilance mode and even though I was working from home, took a few half days to focus on the pup. If she got up _at all_ we went out. If she wanted to walk, we did. If she wanted to go home, we did. If she was active in any way I made certain to offer her food - human food, that she could see me eat - and water. I also made sure to keep a good attitude if she turned it down. If she does not want to eat, her decision. I'd even say to her "No? More for me!" I was not sure if she was going to improve or not, but I was not going to make things worse by getting upset. I'd take one more bite, then ask her "You sure?", and she'd usually take me up on the second offer. Smart pup.

Over the next several days she improved. Initially, she walked only for short distances and with a slow, slightly awkward gait where her front legs were a bit "bow legged". She was "touchy" around her stomach and - though there was no reason to be - in her hip area from the surgery last year for a few days. I had to ease into these areas during tummy rubs, though this returned to normal a few days later. There were a few winces, but less frequent, and after about a week they stopped completely. Same with food. We've been able to transition back to kibble, though now about 20% re-hydrated freeze dried raw meat of one species or another. Rabbit seems to be the favorite. The one hold out is the CBD peanut butter treats that had, until this last visit to VRCC been almost her favorite thing to eat. They still generate zero interest. Happily, bison lung is delicious, and this is what we now dish out for rewards and fun.

## So, What the Hell Was That?

My initial hypothesis, based in part on conversations with several of the vets, was that the tumor had - by coincidence - gotten just big enough to start pinching something around the same time as our ultrasound/FNA visit. Perhaps she needed to adjust how she rose, lay down, and walked to avoid discomfort.

However, as she improved and became herself again - normal kibble, longer walks and with a _normal gait_, keen on critters of every kind, insistent on tummy rubs and a least a little squeaky toy time here and there - this doesn't really fit.

This leads me to a second hypothesis; triggered response. Though required to give us the great additional year we have had, her traumatic experience in surgery and her recovery from it impacted her deeply. A year later the mild discomforts of the FNA soreness and dry/torn paw were just enough to make her think it was happening again. You go to "that place", get shaved and sedated, and a few days later it sucks to be a dog for while. Don't trust the food and don't move too much.

Now, I know that it is easy to read this and just think I am some over anthropomorphizing, over protective dog dad and, well... guilty. 

However, I also know that Patia is smart pup even if she does not have all the information, and _if_ such a response _were_ what happened, it fits what we've observed way better than the first hypothesis.

## Last Days, May They Be Many

Of course, both or neither of these hypotheses may be correct, and at the end of the day what matters is a happy pup. Quality of life was bad enough for a few days that I finally called the the euthanasia specialist I'd made a note of back in the fracture risk days. If Patia is miserable, "intervention" at home in a comfortable place with family near by was an option I knew I should be prepared for, and there were a few days there where I thought it was imminent. Though Patia has "bounced back" in a beautiful and unexpected way, I'm still vigilant of her respiration and mindful that though thankfully happy at the moment, she is still a very sick pooch. The time she stays with us has to be for _her_, and not for me; but I think we have a little longer yet.

My objective remains the same as it has been, to let Patia have as many happy days as possible without trauma - either physical or emotional. And to make sure that whatever (zero to very little fingers crossed) poking and prodding she has yet to endure is with "dad" present so that there can be as much love, and as little fear, as possible.

> Note: The initial version of this doc was more clinical in order to provide information to our vet friends and their staff. Earlier text about Patia was in draft form intended for the 17 September 2020 addition to these essays, but caring for the pup took precedence over writing about her, so revision 0 was tardy.

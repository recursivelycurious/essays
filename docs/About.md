I am a technologist, bibliophile, cinephile, and skeptical empiricist. My thoughts are my own and not those of any employer, publisher, or consulting client. 

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/recursivelycurious/essays/issues) if you believe an essay requires a correction. Any necessary corrections will be made and attributed if you wish, however, this repository does not currently accept pull/merge requests. If you would like to collaborate on a written project, or on a coding project, please likewise open an issue and specify a preferred channel of communication if desired.

Many friends and colleagues have been kind enough to engage - or at least tolerate - my explorations and ramblings on these topics over the years and they are collectively acknowledged here. Specific acknowledgements will be added along with the specific essays.

Any and all mistakes are my own.

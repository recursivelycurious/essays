# The Most Important Person in the Next Election

It is not any of the candidates, or the pundits, or the small army of electioneers working feverishly to win at all costs. No gentle reader, the most important person is _you_, the prospective voter. 

This essay will not speak for or against any candidate or party, ballot measure, or issue. Rather, it will outline a few things prospective voters might consider before finalizing their ballot. And yes, this includes those who finalize their ballot by binning it. Before putting your 2020 vote behind you - if you have not already - please consider the following:

- Yes, real elections have been settled by as little as one vote, and sometimes there have been ties. _Your vote counts_. [<sup>Details</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results) 

- This election is **not** already decided. Not for the top of the ticket, and not for any of the offices or measures under it. You still need to get out and vote. If the 2016 election taught us anything, it is that the pundits can be wrong.

- You do not have to vote for every item on the ballot. Partial participation is significantly better than no participation.  
<sub>_Note: I have seen some articles that suggest skipping items may impact your ballot's inclusion in any recount, which is frustrating. Be aware of this if you choose to skip things, and look into and work to improve how your state handles this. Remember, this is a flaw in how the error checking is implemented, and does not change the fact that voters are supposed to be free to abstain from voting on any specific office or issue without undermining the ability to vote for the others._</sub>

- A ballot is not a test. Aside from the closing time of the polls, you can and should take as much time as you need to understand each issue on the ballot. Measures may be worded in confusing ways on purpose, and the legalize they are written in can be confusing even when it is not intended to be. This is _not you_; we all feel this way. Take your time, and, if you can't make heads or tails of a measure but tried, you can skip it. If the measure can not be understood as written in a reasonable time, making it law may not be a great idea. There is nothing that prohibits a more understandable and readable version on a future ballot.

- You can vote for members of any party for each office. Belonging to a party does _not_ obligate you to vote for candidates _from_ that party. Voting for any one candidate - even a presidential candidate - of one party does not obligate you to vote for that party's candidates in any other office.

- Donating to a campaign or political organization does not obligate you to vote for the candidate or issue those dollars were used to support. Ditto for bumper stickers, facebook posts, and yard signs. If you have re-considered, that is your prerogative.

- Voting does not obligate you to debate or defend your vote to anyone - _aside from yourself_.

- You do not have to vote the same way as your spouse, parent, child, pastor, roshi, rabbi or favorite celebrity would. And no one has to vote as you will. We each have our own vote. 

- You can disagree with specific positions a candidate has, even on highly contested issues, and _still vote for them_.

- Protest votes - meaning votes for candidates that are highly unlikely to earn enough votes to win the office - are legitimate, and can bring visibility to issues and constituencies that have been marginalized or ignored. If a protest vote gets you to participate, and you vote for as many offices and issues as you are able to reach a decision on, great. The more people who participate in our elections, the better.

- As a corollary to the last point, if you intend to vote for a protest candidate, take a moment to consider our initial point regarding close and tied elections. There are many ways to raise the profile and impact of marginalized candidates, issues and constituencies, and for the next two to six years, having a candidate you dislike but _can work with_ could be very valuable for those efforts.

## The Ballot is not the End

There is no such thing as "Not my president" - or Senator, Representative, Governor etc., right down to elected Sheriffs and small town mayors. 

Once the dust settles, the person in the office _has the authority the office provides. If they are incompetent or corrupt the damage done to our institutions and to individuals is very real_. At voters, this impacts our ballot choices. As citizens, this impacts our responsibilities until the next election.

These individuals are public servants, they work for _all of us_, and it is our collective responsibility to work with them when they promote the public good, oppose them when they undermine it, and hold them accountable when they overreach. If the candidate you supported does not win that is _not_ a pass just gripe and complain until the **next** election. Get involved. Get others involved. Not sure where to start? I suggest registering people to vote and encouraging to think about the issues. _Not to agree with you_, but to think about the issues on their own, to attend town halls, to write emails and make calls to officials, to create new parties and run for office.

Regardless of what candidate fills the office, the problems are the same: covid, the economy, the national debt, the conduct of war, the negotiation of peace, the education of our children and the care of and investment in the collective institutions and assets of the nation. The parties, the politics, and the candidates are about prioritizing the problems and what shape the solutions take; and sometimes if the "solutions" have substance beyond making a good tweet or pleasing a crowd at the podium.

If you believe you can do a better job, and are willing to step forward to actually do it, _run for office_. Given the records and behavior of some of the incumbents, you probably can do a better job. But, if you are not already on the ballot, please review the point on protest votes for _this election_ before writing yourself - or your best friend, or your neighbor - in.

# The Most Important Person in the Next Election

It is not any of the candidates, or the pundits, or the small army of electioneers working feverishly to win at all costs. No gentle reader, the most important person is _you_, the prospective voter. 

This essay will not speak for or against any candidate or party, it is simply a few things I would hope prospective voters might consider before finalizing their ballot. And yes, this includes those who finalize their ballot by binning it. Before putting your 2020 vote behind you, please consider the following:

- Yes, real elections have been settled by as little as one vote, and sometimes there have been ties. _Your vote counts_. [<sup>*</sup>](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_close_election_results) 

- This election is **not** already decided. Not for the top of the ticket, and not for any of the items under it. You still need to get out and vote. If the 2016 election taught us anything, it is that the pundits can be wrong.

- You do not have to vote for every item on the ballot. Partial participation is significantly better than no participation.

- A ballot is not a test. Aside from the closing time of the polls, you can and should take as much time as you need to understand each issue on the ballot. Measures may be worded in confusing ways on purpose, and the legalize they are written in can be confusing even when it is not meant to be. This is not you, we all feel this way. Take your time, and, if you can't make heads or tails of a measure but tried, you can skip it. If the measure can not be understood as written in a reasonable time, making it law may not be a great idea.

- You can vote for members of any party for each office. Belonging to a party does _not_ obligate you to vote for those candidates. Voting for any one candidate - even a presidential candidate - of one party does not obligate you to vote for that party's candidates in any other office.

- Donating to a campaign or political organization does not obligate you to vote for the candidate or issue those dollars were used to support. Ditto for bumper stickers, facebook posts, and yard signs. If you have re-considered, that is your prerogative.

- Voting does not obligate you to debate or defend your vote to anyone - _aside from yourself_.

- You do not have to vote the same way as your spouse, parent, child, pastor/roshi/rabbi would. And no one has to vote as you will. We each have our own vote. 

- You can disagree with specific positions a candidate has, even on highly contested issues, and still vote for them.

- Protest votes - meaning votes for candidates that are highly unlikely to earn enough votes to win the office - are legitimate, and can bring visibility to issues and constituencies that have been ignored. If a protest vote gets you to participate, and you vote for as many offices and issues as you are able to reach a decision on, great. The more people who participate in our elections, the better.

- As a corollary to the last point, if you intend to vote for a protest candidate, take a moment to consider our initial point regarding close and tied elections. There are many ways to raise the profile and impact of marginalized candidates, issues and constituencies, and for the next two to six years, having a candidate you dislike but _can work with_ could be very valuable for those efforts.

- There is no such thing as "Not my president" - or Senator, Representative, Governor etc., right down to elected Sheriffs and small town mayors. Once the dust settles, the person in the office _has the authority the office provides, and if they are corrupt they may significantly overreach_. Voting is _part_ of our civic responsibilities in a government "Of the people, by the people, and for the people" and the fact that the candidate you did not support wins and holds the office is _not_ a pass on doing your part until and at the **next** election to hold all of our public servants accountable.

- If you believe you can do a better job, and are willing to step forward to actually do it, _run for office_. Given the records and behavior of some of the incumbents, you probably can do a better job. But, if you are not already on the ballot, please review the point on protest votes for _this election_ before writing yourself - or your best friend, or your neighbor - in.

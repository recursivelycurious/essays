## About


I am a technologist, bibliophile, cinephile, and skeptical empiricist. My thoughts are my own and not those of any employer, publisher, or consulting client. 

## Errata

Please [create an issue](https://github.com/recursivelycurious/essays/issues) if you believe an essay requires a correction. Civil, well reasoned, and evidence based request for correction or revision is welcomed. Factual corrections will be made, however, editorial disagreements may not result in any change of the published material, though the issue will be present for all to review. Modifications of the content will point to the issue in question and include any appropriate attribution as requested or as appropriate to any revision. This repository does not currently accept pull/merge requests. If you would like to collaborate on a written project, or on a coding project, please likewise open an issue and specify a preferred channel of communication if desired.

## Revisions

In the age of technological publication modifying content is a reality. There are benefits to this, since learning and growth are both processes of revision and correction, though other less admirable motives are present in some or many sources. This collection seeks to make revisions explicit and transparent, available for all to see if they wish. All changes are tracked using git version control, so everyone can know what changed and when. At the same time, the current version represents what I believe is most complete, accurate, and authentic - some essays will be quite personal - and examining earlier revisions is a choice left to each reader. To find earlier versions, examine the git history.

## Acknowledgements

Many friends and colleagues have been kind enough to engage - or at least tolerate - my explorations and ramblings on these topics over the years and they are collectively acknowledged here. Specific acknowledgements will be added along with the specific essays.

Any and all mistakes are my own.
